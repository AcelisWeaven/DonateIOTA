# IOTA Donation page

A easy-to-fork template allowing IOTA community developers to maintain their donation address in a single place.

Demo: https://acelisweaven.github.io/DonateIOTA/

## What is this page?

This page is a fork-friendly page template aiming to help community developers update their donation address and share it easily.

## But why?

Today, when an IOTA developer changes his donation address, he has to update it everywhere.

With this template, the single thing a developer has to do is to update his [address.txt file](address.txt).

This file can also be fetched by a machine to automatically gather a developer's donation address.

## How can I use this template?
[Fork the repository](https://github.com/AcelisWeaven/DonateIOTA/fork), change *address.txt* and *index.html* and you're done.

Your donation URL will look like:

https://*your-github-username*.github.io/DonateIOTA
